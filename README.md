RPi-iBeacon-Scanner
===================

The goal is to create a setup that will scan for iBeacons with a Raspberry Pi.  
This will probably use ibeacon_scan developed by Radius Networks and then piped into another script that 
will do something with the information.  That something is undefined right now.
